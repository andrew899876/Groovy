#HelloWorldGroovy
This is my first basic app using groovy.  

in its current state it simple creates to objects, a fish and a sparrow 

It will tell you the fish is swimming and the bird is flapping its wings (Exciting!!).  

This app is works to not only learn how to use GGroovy, but also to polish up on my Java programming skill and OOP skills.
